This project introduces a smart and secure chatbot system built using Spring Boot and powered by a locally runninglanguage model through Ollama. The goal was to create a privacy-focused chatbot that can hold meaningful conversations
 while also filtering out harmful or inappropriate messages using a built-in content firewall. The system uses Googleâ€™s Gemma 3:1b model to generate responses, with all communication happening
 securely over REST APIs and structured using JSON
